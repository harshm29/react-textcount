# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-

1. Create a simple textarea and add necessary styling.
2. There should be a customisable character count limit to your textarea.
3. Show this limit below the textarea. Improvement - You can add progress circle showing the count.
4. If characters goes beyond the limit, highlight them, decrease the count to negative value and disable the submit button.
5. You can also add warnings when only the 10% character limit is remaining.
6. If a user is adding symbols such as @ or # made them as a link with relevant href.
7. After a submit button, display that paragraph.
